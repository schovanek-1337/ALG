# Plesichronous Engine
A 3D game engine utilizing the LWJGL3(3.2.3) library. It runs on OpenGL, using OpenGL 4.5 functions in some places, so make sure your GPU is atleast 7 years old. The optimization at the moment is non-existent, but it runs fine on my pc.

My specs for comparison:
	
	CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (12) @ 3.600GHz
	GPU: AMD ATI Radeon RX 5700 XT
	Memory: 16 GB
	OS: Arch Linux

## Usage
It really isn't much use right now, but I'm building an old-school shooter on it right now.
